						<p class="job-description">Validated, pitched, coordinated a project that gathered all the historic data from customer support requests and categorized them based on context. A rails application was then written to deliver pointed and highly accurate help topic suggestion actively as a customer was writing their support ticket. The app then took the data one step further by analyzing each hit and up-vote. It used this new data to learn which help topics customers found most useful and served those up as priority next time a customer's help request contained similar context. The project won an unprecedented 3 out of the 4 possible awards taking; Best In Show, Greatest Technical Achievement, and Most Original.

						<p class="job-description">The goal of this project was to bring the various departments involved in the customer onboarding process together to create what I pitched as a unified customer onboarding experience. The premise was simple, stitch together the many project timelines a customer experiences into unified in-app timeline. This was achieved by pointing the customer to the software and by adding a new page to the existing rails app that contained a more attractive easier to follow onboarding timeline. The lasting impact was to immerse the customer in the software as soon as possible to solidify them as AppFolio customers and product promoters.
